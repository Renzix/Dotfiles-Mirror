# DOTFILES
Hi these are some of my dot files. Nothing fancy just BSPWM with some light scripting and other config stuff.

# Plans
In the future im probably going to make a config for other window
managers including probably including dwm and more. Maybe write/steal
a nice conky and change my tint2 to another bar like lemonbar or
polybar(although i hate trying to find good fonts). Also possibly
write a really good vimrc that does NOT depend on a plugin manager as
i use emacs for stuff that does.
