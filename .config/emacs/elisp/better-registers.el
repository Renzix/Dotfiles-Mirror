;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a row of commands, and keyboard shortcuts to
;; make the powerful concept of registers even more powerful (most
;; important it lets you save macros there), and to save them to a
;; file. It is collected as a minor mode.

;; The code requires the cl.el (common-lisp-wannabe extensions) package
;; It is not tested under xemacs

;;; Installation:

;; dump this file somwhere on your load path. Then insert the
;; following into your .emacs (or other file loaded at startup) (of
;; course removing the ;;'s

;; ;;;Better registers!
;; (require 'better-registers)
;; (better-registers-install-save-registers-hook)
;; (load better-registers-save-file)

;; The last two line are unnecessary if you do not want to have your
;; registers contents saved across sessions.

;; Note that this package is pretty harsh to your std shortcuts you
;; probably should edit them (or at least see them through this file
;; to suit your needs. I e.g. personally never used backwards searches,
;; so C-r was doomed in my hands. I use only enter for indented
;; linebreaks, so C-j also seemed as a nice candidate for something
;; more useful - you might want to bind:
;; (global-set-key "\r" 'newline-and-indent)

;;; Use:

;; Macros: record a macro as usual and then press C-r m to save the
;; macro in a register. You now can play the macro with C-j

;; Markers: (as usual) Place point a place you want to remember C-r
;; space will put the marker in a register. When the buffer is closed
;; or the register is saved and reloaded it is turned into a
;; file-query that is a question about whether to reopen the file. C-j
;; will bring you back to the marker.

;; Window/Frame-configurations: C-rw and C-rf will save the current
;; configuration in the given register. To recall use C-j
;; Remark: these will not be saved for next session :(

;; Other stuff: for rectangles and numbers see through the list of
;; key-shortcuts and get good ideas.

;; In modes which overwrite C-j C-xj should still be bound to the same.

  "The version of the package better-registers.
   Revision history:
   from 0.59 to 0.60 User can choose to use C-r or not optionally
   from 0.58 to 0.59 Add support for both Emacs 24.4 and older
   from 0.57 to 0.58 Improved interactive argument handling of better-registers-save-registers.
   from 0.57 to 0.57 Can now correctly save fontified strings, added convenient macro key (f1)
   from 0.55 to 0.56 No longer blocks enter in the minibuffer
   from 0.5 to 0.55 changed it to a minor mode
   instead of having global keys - much nicer! Thanks to Lennart Borgman
   for the advice.")
