Hello This is my second real attempt to make a "Perfect" config. Idk
if it will ever be good enough but here it is. Note this is available
on [[https://gitlab.com/Renzix/Dotfiles][gitlab]] and it should be mirrored on [[https://github.com/Renzix/Dotfiles-Mirror][github]]. There are multiple
versions of this file including [[file:index.html][readtheorg]], [[file:index.txt][plain text]] and [[file:index.md][markdown]]
for now.

Some decisions are inspired by

[[https://jamiecollinson.com/blog/my-emacs-config/][jamiecollinson]]: General layout \\
[[https://github.com/buffet/rice/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/config.org][Buffet]]: Random stuff and Actual help \\

#+begin_attention
Made to work with emacs 26 and 27 on windows, linux, and macos
#+end_attention

I automatically export my themes to my [[https:renzix.github.io/Dotfiles-Mirror][github pages]] docs directory on
save. This is not async because emacs sucks with async and it will
prompt me on open of file and of emacs. It definetly could be better
but it keeps my config/website up to date. This block is not tangled
so it only runs on save of the file. Maybe this will make me only save
when necessary.

#+name: export-to-docs

* Plans

Some things I plan on doing or trying out.
- Let init.el byte compile file
- Add more language support
- Add macros to my config so i dont have to use use-package some
  include.
  - [ ] [[pkg!]] Defines a package which you can use! or cfg!. You can
    either pass in a named repo or a git repo. Also maybe what minor modes and more
  - [ ] [[use!]]  This package only loads when a specific requirement
    is met ie major mode
  - [ ] [[cfg!]] evaluates a list before and after the package is
    loaded. Only runs if use! has been defined.
  - [ ] [[key!]] defines a key depending on state and optionally map. Only runs
    if use! has been defined and runs after cfg is loaded.
  - [ ] [[ex!]] defines a ex command (just a alias basically)

* Startup

Starts up emacs. This should be somewhat small and only for
proccesses that are required to run first. Also there is a small [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57153556/why-does-emacs-fail-to-install-gnu-elpa-keyring-update-and-some-other-package][bug]]
which is annoying.

** Enable local variable check

I disable the check for safety in [[file:init.el][init.el]] so that I dont have to
press y/n on startup. I would like to be somewhat safe and eval
code at the top so I reactivate the check here.

#+name: enable-local-eval
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq enable-local-eval 'maybe
        enable-local-variables t)
#+end_src

** Configure package sources

Melpa is nice because its more bleeding edge. Elpa is the general
GNU repo which everyone should probably have anyway.

#+name: melpa
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
  (setq package-archives
        '(("elpa"     . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
          ("melpa"        . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
        package-archive-priorities
        '(("elpa"     . 5) ("melpa"        . 10)))
  ;; bug in macos
  (when (string= system-type "darwin")
    (setq gnutls-algorithm-priority "NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3"))
#+end_src

** Bootstrap use-package

install =use-package= if not already installed.

#+name: use-package
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install 'use-package))
  (require 'use-package)
  (require 'use-package-ensure)
#+end_src

Makes sure that =use-package= always downloads the package if not available

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+end_src
** quelpa

Quelpa is another way to get packages and it basically wraps around
git repositories. Its really nice if you want bleeding edge stuff
and also it has a [[use-package]] with the keyword :quelpa.

#+name: quelpa-use-package
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package quelpa
    :init (setq quelpa-upgrade-p t))
  (use-package quelpa-use-package) 
#+end_src
** Increase garbage collector threshold

The default garbage collection threshold is 800kB, increasing this
to 10MB for startup increases speed.

#+name: garbage-collection
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq gc-cons-threshold 10000000)

  ;; Restore after startup
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook
            (lambda ()
              (setq gc-cons-threshold 1000000)
              (message "gc-cons-threshold restored to %S"
                       gc-cons-threshold)))
#+end_src

** Set custom settings to load in own file

This stops emacs adding customised settings to =init.el=. I try to
avoid using customize anyway, preferring programmatic control of
variables. Creating it as a temporary file effectively disables it
(i.e. any changes are session local).

#+name: custom
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file (make-temp-file "emacs-custom"))
#+end_src

** Package Macros

These are my package macros which I will be using to download and
install packages. Preferably these will be as lazy loaded as
possible.

*** TODO pkg!

This defines a package which you can use! or cfg!. Ideally
disabling this doesnt actually load the package but tells you
where to find it. Doesnt load while im still testing it.

#+name: pkg!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar pkg!-list nil)
  (setq pkg!-list nil)

  (defun pkg! (&rest rest) ;; @TODO(Renzix:
    "Defines the packages and save it as NAME and LOC.  LOC is the
    location.  This accepts a unlimited amount of params throught REST"
    (setq rest (seq-partition rest 2))
    (cl-loop for x in rest do
             (let ((name (car x))
                   (loc (car (cdr x))))
               (message "name: %s loc: %s" name loc)
               ;; Check if LOC is a defined repo if not then check if it is a
               ;; website (for git) if not then assume its a github user/reponame
               (cond ((string= loc "Melpa")
                      (add-to-list 'pkg!-list `(,name ,loc)))
                     (t (error-message-string (format "Location %s for %s not implemented" loc name)))))
             (setq rest (cdr rest))))
  (pkg! "use-package" "Melpa" "ree" "Melpa")
  (message "%s" pkg!-list)
#+end_src

*** TODO use!

First looks to see if the package is defined with pkg!. If it is
then define when you want to run the load code with a function
which returns true. Also define when that code will be checked ie
what hook. After all that run cfg! if it is defined.

*** TODO cfg!

define 2 lists which will get evaluated. The first list will be
evaluated before the package is loaded. the second list will be
ran after the package is loaded.


*** TODO key!
*** TODO ex!
* Preferences

Some preferences I like/dont like about emacs. Basically trying to
make the defaults better.

** SOMEDAY Buffers

- Note taken on [2019-08-18 Sun 21:53]  \\
  Make it so this only triggers on laptop? Also add a section for my variables.

Dont display startscreen on startup. I used to use eshell but now
that I have ss as a keybinding I don't think its nessisary.

#+name: initial-buffer
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-startup-screen t
        initial-buffer-choice nil)
#+end_src

Buffers dont ask for confirmation when killed while doing a
job. Makes things much easier/simpler and when I close one i know
im closing it.

#+name: confirm-kill-processes
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq confirm-kill-processes nil)
#+end_src

Nice little display for my battery.

#+name: battery
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (display-battery-mode)
#+end_src

** Display

Some things that nobody ever should enable. Ever. menu-bar,
tool-bar and scroll-bar all require a mouse so they suck.

#+name: bar-disable
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src

Disables more then 2 windows spawning as this makes magit alot more
annoying and in general only 2 windows are nessisary.

#+name: two-windows
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq split-width-threshold (- (window-width) 10))
  (setq split-height-threshold nil)
  (defun count-visible-buffers (&optional frame)
    "Count how many buffers are currently being shown.  Defaults to selected FRAME."
    (length (mapcar #'window-buffer (window-list frame))))
  (defun do-not-split-more-than-two-windows (window &optional horizontal)
    "WINDOW HORIZONTAL."
    (if (and horizontal (> (count-visible-buffers) 1))
        nil
      t))
  (advice-add 'window-splittable-p :before-while #'do-not-split-more-than-two-windows)
#+end_src

In evil relative line numbers are really nice. This also allows the
current line number to not be 0 but whatever the actual line number
it is. Having 0 is kinda useless in relative line numbers. This is
disabled for [[vterm]] because it doesnt deal with it well.

#+name: line-numbers
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (when (>= emacs-major-version 26)
    (global-display-line-numbers-mode)
    (setq-default display-line-numbers-type 'relative
                  display-line-numbers-current-absolute t
                  display-line-numbers-width 3
                  display-line-numbers-widen t))
#+end_src

There are alot of good themes out there and having a single theme
is boring so I make it switch depending on the day of the
week. Also the theme stays default if emacs is ran in the terminal
because the themes that are good suck in the terminal and black is
good enough. There is a bug with monokai on macos and windows where
it loads without me telling it to. Because of this i have to
enable/disable it...

#+name: theme
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (when (display-graphic-p)
    (defvar renzix-weekday (format-time-string "%w"))
    (use-package doom-themes)
    (use-package apropospriate-theme)
    (use-package monokai-theme
      :config 
      (load-theme 'monokai t)
      (disable-theme 'monokai))
    (cond ((string= "0" renzix-weekday) ;; Sunday
           (load-theme 'doom-dracula t))
          ((string= "1" renzix-weekday) ;; Monday
           (load-theme 'doom-opera t))
          ((string= "2" renzix-weekday) ;; Tuesday
           (load-theme 'apropospriate-dark t))
          ((string= "3" renzix-weekday) ;; Wednesday
           (load-theme 'doom-molokai t))
          ((string= "4" renzix-weekday) ;; Thursday
           (load-theme 'doom-nord t))
          ((string= "5" renzix-weekday) ;; Friday
           (load-theme 'monokai t))
          ((string= "6" renzix-weekday) ;; Saturday
           (load-theme 'doom-one t))))

Evil is cool and i want to be able to tell what state I am in
without having to look at the bottom left. One easy way to do this
is change the color and type of the cursor. It changes the type but
not the color by default and normal is the same as emacs
state. However because i have god-mode It does not come with a easy
way of doing this so i have a function to update it.

#+name: evil-cursor
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq evil-insert-state-cursor '(bar "#ff00ff")
        evil-normal-state-cursor '(box "#6666f6")
        evil-motion-state-cursor '(hollow "#87d7ff")
        evil-replace-state-cursor '(hollow "#bf2222")
        evil-operator-state-cursor '(box "#F5F5DC")
        evil-visual-state-cursor '(hollow "#ffffff")
        evil-emacs-state-cursor '(hbar "#43DE43"))
  (setq-default cursor-type 'hbar)
  (set-cursor-color "#43DE43")
  (defun my/update-god-cursor (&rest args)
    "Update the cursor from god-mode."
    (cond 
     ((eq god-local-mode t) ;; if i just do god-local-mode it thinks its a function
      (set-cursor-color "#FFFF00")
      (setq cursor-type 'box))
     ((eq evil-state 'emacs)
      (set-cursor-color "#43DE43")
      (setq cursor-type 'hbar))))
#+end_src

Beeing able to see matching parens is nice so lets enable
parens-mode. I could only enable this for specific modes but i
think this is extremely useful always.

#+name: show-paren-mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (show-paren-mode 1)
#+end_src

TODO and other stuff should have a different color so lets enable
that. Also there is a feature of emacs to highlight the current
line so lets also enable that.

#+name: highlight
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-hl-todo-mode)
  (global-hl-line-mode)
#+end_src

** Other

By default symlinks should always be followed. Makes it much easier
to deal with dynamic stuff like my config. Instead of asking me if
I want to follow it.

#+name: symlinks
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq vc-follow-symlinks t)
#+end_src

Typing yes or no is hard and y or n is easier so lets do that
instead.

#+name: yes-or-no-p
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+end_src

Use spaces instead of tabs by default. Either is fine to me however
I have to choose one and only one.

#+name: indent-default
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
#+end_src

Emacs backups are kinda weird by default as they apear in the same
directory as the file. Also the tilda is kinda weird syntax so I
make it a single folder and have lots of backups as I dont need the
space.

#+name: backups
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq backup-directory-alist `(("." . "~/.saves"))
        backup-by-copying t
        delete-old-versions t
        kept-new-versions 10
        kept-old-versions 10
        version-control t)
#+end_src

Sometimes i enable this because warnings r annoying

#+name: warn-level
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq warning-minimum-level :error)
#+end_src

If you set the variable kill-whole-line then the kill-line will
delete the entire line including newline if at the beginning of the
line.

#+name: kill-whole-line
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq kill-whole-line t)
#+end_src

Use utf-8 when you can

#+name: prefer-coding-system
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
#+end_src

** Useful Functions
*** Edit Text

Made specifically for insert state but works in other
states. Deletes backwards until a space. Not a true vim word or
WORD.

#+name: evil-insert-delete-back-word
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/evil-insert-delete-back-word ()
    "Made specifically for insert state but works in other
  states. Deletes backwards until a space. Not a true vim word or
  WORD."
    (interactive)
    (delete-region
     (point)
     (save-excursion (skip-syntax-backward "^ ") (point))))
#+end_src

This is in vim but not in evil. Reverts any changes that were made
on the current line in insert mode.

#+name: evil-insert-undo-line
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/evil-insert-undo-line ()
    "Undo a line in insert mode."
    (interactive)
    (if (looking-back "^" 0)
        (backward-delete-char 1)
      (if (looking-back "^\s*" 0)
          (delete-region (point) (line-beginning-position))
        (evil-delete
         (+ (line-beginning-position) (current-indentation)) (point)))))
#+end_src

*** Format Text

#+name: indent-buffer
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/smart-indent ()
    "If a region is selected indent that.
  If given ARG indent the current line.
  Else indent the entire buffer."
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (if (region-active-p) (progn
                              (indent-region (region-beginning) (region-end))
                              (message "Indenting region")))
      (if current-prefix-arg
          (progn
            (indent-region (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position))
            (message "Indenting line"))
        (progn
          (indent-region (point-min) (point-max))
          (message "Identing buffer")))))
#+end_src

Smart indentation that i found [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NoTabs][here]]. Infers indentation based on
the amount of tabs/spaces in the current buffer. If its a new
buffer then use the [[indent-default][default value]].

#+name: infer-identation-style
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/infer-indentation-style ()
    (let ((space-count (how-many "^  " (point-min) (point-max)))
          (tab-count (how-many "^\t" (point-min) (point-max))))
      (if (> space-count tab-count) (setq indent-tabs-mode nil))
      (if (> tab-count space-count) (setq indent-tabs-mode t))))
#+end_src

*** File Handling

Emacs is actually stupid and if you try to rename a open file it
wont effect the buffer. You then end up with 2 files and you have
to either close or rename the buffer. This should be in emacs by
default idk why its not.

#+name: rename-file-and-buffer
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/rename-file-and-buffer ()
    "Renames current buffer and file it is visiting."
    (interactive)
    (let* ((name (buffer-name))
           (filename (buffer-file-name))
           (basename (file-name-nondirectory filename)))
      (if (not (and filename (file-exists-p filename)))
          (error "Buffer '%s' is not visiting a file!" name)
        (let ((new-name (read-file-name "New name: "
                                        (file-name-directory filename) basename nil basename)))
          (if (get-buffer new-name)
              (error "A buffer named '%s' already exists!" new-name)
            (rename-file filename new-name 1)
            (rename-buffer new-name)
            (set-visited-file-name new-name)
            (set-buffer-modified-p nil)
            (message "File '%s' successfully renamed to '%s'"
                     name (file-name-nondirectory new-name)))))))
#+end_src

This is the same problem as the function above. Emacs does not
close the buffer you have open if you delete the file so you might
accidently save it. Better to just call this function if the buffer
is open.

#+name: delete-file-and-buffer
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun delete-file-and-buffer ()
    "Kill the current buffer and deletes the file it is visiting."
    (interactive)
    (let ((filename (buffer-file-name)))
      (when filename
        (if (vc-backend filename)
            (vc-delete-file filename)
          (progn
            (delete-file filename)
            (message "Deleted file %s" filename)
            (kill-buffer))))))
#+end_src

Reads a string directly from a file then returns it as a string

#+name: get-string-from-file
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/get-string-from-file (filePath)
    "Return filePath's file content."
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert-file-contents filePath)
      (buffer-string)))
#+end_src

*** SOMEDAY Projects

- Note taken on [2019-08-18 Sun 21:53]  \\
  Make a =projectile-create-tags= that also works on windows

This first sees if it is in a projectile project. If it isnt then
it will ask for one then run =projectile-find-file=. If it is then
it will just run =projectile-find-file=. Just a better default.

#+name: helm-projectile-find-file-or-project
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/helm-projectile-find-file-or-project ()
    "Does switch project if not in a project and 'find-file' if in one."
    (interactive)
    (if (projectile-project-p)
        (helm-projectile-find-file)
      (helm-projectile-switch-project)))
#+end_src

This one runs =helm-projectile-find-file= if in a project but
normal =helm-find-file= if not inside a project.

#+name: helm-projectile-find-file-or-find-file
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/helm-projectile-find-file-or-find-file ()
    "Does switch project if not in a project and 'find-file' if in one."
    (interactive)
    (if (projectile-project-p)
        (helm-projectile-find-file)
      (helm-find-files nil)))
#+end_src

This first sees if it is in a projectile project. If it isnt then
it will ask for one then both of them run =helm-projectile-ag= or
=helm-projectile-rg= depending on if you are in windows or
something else. I made this fix because helm-projectile-rg didnt
work on windows but maybe i should try again later (rg does work
on windows just not the emacs plugin).

#+name: helm-projectile-search-or-project
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/helm-projectile-search-or-project ()
    "Does switch project if not in a project and search all files in said project."
    (interactive)
    (if (projectile-project-p)
        (if (string-equal system-type "windows-nt")
            (helm-projectile-ag)
          (helm-projectile-rg))
      (helm-projectile-switch-project)))
#+end_src

Creates tags for all the files. I need to get something like this
that works properly on windows.

#+name: create-tags
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** SOMEDAY Open Buffer

- Note taken on [2019-08-18 Sun 21:54]  \\
  Add doas-edit or make [[sudo-edit]] check for bsd/doas

I like using eshell and vterm but dealing with emacs buffers is
actually insane. I made a coupld simple functions to switch to a
vterm/eshell window and then be able to switch back. This makes
them fullscreen which is hella nice. This is the variable that
stores the perspective.

#+name: my:window-conf
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar my/window-conf nil)
#+end_src

Here is the eshell toggle function which uses said variable to
switch if not already in a eshell buffer fullscreen.

#+name: eshell-toggle
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/eshell-toggle (buf-name)
    "Switch to eshell and save persp.  BUF-NAME is the current buffer name."
    (interactive (list (buffer-name)))
    (if (string-equal buf-name "*eshell*")
        (set-window-configuration my/window-conf)
      (progn
        (setq my/window-conf (current-window-configuration))
        (delete-other-windows)
        (eshell))))
#+end_src

This is for the next funciton. vterm doesnt automatically switch
if called and open so i need a helper function.

#+name: switch-to-vterm
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/switch-to-vterm ()
    "Switch to vterm."
    (if (get-buffer "vterm")
        (switch-to-buffer "vterm")
      (vterm)))
#+end_src

Function to switch to a fullscreen terminal and back again without
losing your current layout.

#+name: vterm-toggle
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/vterm-toggle (buf-name)
    "Switch to vterm and save persp.  BUF-NAME is the current buffer name."
    (interactive (list (buffer-name)))
    (if (string-equal buf-name "vterm")
        (set-window-configuration my:window-conf)
      (progn
        (setq my:window-conf (current-window-configuration))
        (delete-other-windows)
        (switch-to-vterm))))
#+end_src

Opens magit status in a single buffer because its so much easier to
work with a do git things. I dont really need to see the file I was
working on as I can just see the changes in =magit-status=

#+name: magit-status-only
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/magit-status-only ()
    "Opens magit-status in a single buffer."
    (magit-status)
    (delete-other-windows))
#+end_src

Opens the current buffer with sudo. Again this probably should be
default or at least some form of it as this doesnt work if you dont
have sudo. Maybe there is a cross platform su thing for tramp? idk

#+name: sudo-edit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/sudo-edit (&optional arg)
    "Edits a file with sudo priv.  Optionally take a ARG for the filename."
    (interactive "P")
    (if (or arg (not buffer-file-name))
        (find-file
         (concat "/sudo:root@localhost:"
                 (ido-read-file-name "Find file(as root): ")))
      (find-alternate-file (concat "/sudo:root@localhost:" buffer-file-name))))
#+end_src

Opens my emacs configuration for editing.

#+name: open-emacs-config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/open-emacs-config ()
    "Opens my Emacs config uwu."
    (interactive)
    (find-file "~/Dotfiles/.emacs.d/config.org"))
#+end_src

*** SOMEDAY Eval

Helper function for smart-eval. Says if its valid lisp or not.
Functions that help you do evalution of functions and deal with
stuff.

#+name: valid-elisp-p :tangle no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/valid-elisp-p (s)
    "S is a string."
    (and (listp (read s))

*** Redefined Functions

This is C-a redefined to go to first nonwhitespace then if pressed
again go to actual start of line. Stolen from [[https://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/05/22/smarter-navigation-to-the-beginning-of-a-line/][here]] and from [[https://github.com/bbatsov/crux][crux]].

#+name: move-beginning-of-line
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/move-beginning-of-line (arg)
    "Move point back to indentation of beginning of line.

  Move point to the first non-whitespace character on this line.
  If point is already there, move to the beginning of the line.
  Effectively toggle between the first non-whitespace character and
  the beginning of the line.

  If ARG is not nil or 1, move forward ARG - 1 lines first.  If
  point reaches the beginning or end of the buffer, stop there."
    (interactive "^p")
    (setq arg (or arg 1))

    ;; Move lines first
    (when (/= arg 1)
      (let ((line-move-visual nil))

    (let ((orig-point (point)))
      (move-beginning-of-line 1)
      (when (= orig-point (point))
        (back-to-indentation))))
#+end_src

This is a function close to evil o and O which is pretty useful in
alot of scenerios. I have 0 idea why this isnt in emacs already. This
was also mainly stolen from [[https://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/03/26/smarter-open-line/][this]] and [[https://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/06/15/open-line-above/][this]] which was based off of [[https://github.com/bbatsov/crux][crux]] emacs
extension.

#+name: smart-open-line
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/smart-open-line (arg)
    "Insert an empty line after the current line.
  Position the cursor at its beginning, according to the current mode."

* Core
** Key Packages
*** evil

Evil is vi emulation in emacs. It is by far the best vi emulation
outside of vi itself and very extendable/fast.

#+name: evil
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package evil
    :config 
    (setq evil-default-state 'emacs) ;; For now this will always be emacs state so i get used to it
    (evil-mode 1))
#+end_src

=evil-collection= is a project which provides evil keybindings for
almost every popular plugin in emacs outside of a few. Its really
nice if you want to use evil in buffers where its very emacsy. A
list of all keybindings and supported packages can be found
[[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][here]]. One of the nonsupported packages is magit so here is
[[file:config.org::*evil-magit][evil-magit]] config. Also [[evil-magit]] has to load before evil so it
needs to set evil-want-keybinding to nil.

#+name: evil-collection
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package evil-collection
    :after '(evil evil-magit)
    :config (evil-collection-init))
#+end_src

=evil-goggles= makes it so that every edit you do is highlighted
for a brief period of time. This makes it much easier to know
exactly what you are doing and also looks cool af.

#+name: evil-goggles
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package evil-goggles
    :after evil
    :config (progn
              (evil-goggles-mode)
              (evil-goggles-use-diff-faces)))
#+end_src

=evil-matchit= makes % work for alot of different things. All of
them are listed [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/evil-matchit][here]].

#+name: evil-matchit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package evil-matchit
    :after evil
    :config (global-evil-matchit-mode 1))
#+end_src

*** god mode

God mode is a way to bring a prefix like style of keybinds to
emacs. It allows you to press a prefix key then all your keybinds
are like holding Control. In order to "let go" of the control you
press spacebar first. In order to use alt instead do a g prefix. A
G prefix its the same as Control and Alt. Color wise I have it use
a yellow box and a green underscore for normal emacs mode. There
is no good way of telling when you change buffer focus so I just
have it run after every command.

#+name: god-mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun god-mode-revert-if-buffer-changed (orig &rest args)
    (apply orig args)
    (when (not (eq (current-buffer) god-mode-current-buffer))
      (when god-local-mode
        (god-local-mode))
      (my/update-god-cursor)))

  (use-package god-mode
    :config
    (defvar god-mode-current-buffer nil)
    (add-hook 'post-command-hook 'my/update-god-cursor) ;; There is no good way to do this
    (advice-add 'window-configuration-change-hook :after 'my/update-god-cursor)
    (advice-add 'god-mode-maybe-activate :around 'god-mode-revert-if-buffer-changed))
#+end_src

*** general

General keybindings most of the ones i use are going to be defined here
as a general rule of thumb i am using , instead of C-c and those are going
to be defined in other packages.

#+name: general
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package general)
#+end_src

*** key-chord

key-chord allows you to make key strokes that only trigger if you
press them fast enough. This makes for some pretty interesting
ideas and allows you to bind a nonprefix key to a prefix. This is
a very underused package imo because pressing the same character 2
times in a row is very easy.

#+name: key-chord
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package key-chord
    :config (key-chord-mode 1))
#+end_src

*** avy


Avy is nice to use. Its hard to explain just look at the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/avy][github]] gifs.
#+name: avy
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package avy)
#+end_src

** Fuzzy Find
*** helm

Helm is a fuzzy finder search for ANYTHING you want in emacs. It
also has alot of plugins that work with other plugins. The two
alternatives is ivy and ido. Helm is the heaviest however it also
has the most features. Ivy is the simpliest and has the smallest
code base. Ivy is also very extendable and easier to work with
then helm or ido. Ido comes default with emacs and is said to be
the fastest but has a more complex code base then ivy.

Helm has actions based on whatever you want to do at that
point. You can think of it like a litteral search based tui.

#+name: helm
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my/helm-projectile-from-find-files ()
    (interactive)
    (helm-run-after-exit
     (lambda ()
       (let ((default-directory helm-ff-default-directory)
             (projectile-require-project-root nil))
         (helm-projectile-find-file-dwim)))))
  ;; This is mainly for [[helm-projectile]]
  (defun my/helm-goto-find-files ()
    (interactive)
    (helm-run-after-exit
     (lambda ()
       (let ((default-directory (helm-basedir (helm-get-selection))))
         (helm-find-files nil)))))

  (defun my/helm-goto-helm-occur ()
    (interactive)
    (helm-run-after-exit
     (lambda ()
       (helm-occur))))

  (defun my/helm-goto-helm-rg ()
    (interactive)
    (helm-run-after-exit
     (lambda ()
       (my/helm-projectile-search-or-project))))

  (use-package helm
    :init
    (setq helm-follow-mode-persistent t
          helm-autoresize-max-height 40
          helm-display-header-line nil)
    :config
    (require 'helm-config)
    (helm-autoresize-mode t)
    (add-hook 'helm-minibuffer-set-up-hook 'helm-hide-minibuffer-maybe)
    (helm-mode t))
#+end_src

Helm has a plugin you can use to use ripgrep as the search
tool. This is required if I want to use helm-projectile-rg.

#+name: helm-rg
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm-rg
    :after helm)
#+end_src

*** SOMEDAY ido
*** SOMEDAY ivy
** Version Control
*** Git
**** Magit

Magit is one of the greatest emacs packages to exist. It allows
the power of git in a tui/gui/cli form depending on what is
needed. Note this is disabled because it is not [[evil]] enough

#+name: magit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit)
#+end_src

**** Forge

This is in beta but forge allows [[magit]] to talk to github and
gitlab in order to deal with Pull Requests and Issues.

#+name: forge
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package forge
    :after magit)
#+end_src
**** evil-magit

[[Magit]] isnt [[evil]] enough. It doesnt have standard [[evil]] keybindings
and rebinds stuff like j and k. evil-magit fixes this by
rebinding them and this is one of the only packages that isnt
supported by [[evil-collection]]. For some fucking reason this has to
load before evil so it also needs evil-want-keybinding for
[[evil-collection]].

#+name: evil-magit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package evil-magit
    :init (setq evil-want-keybinding nil))
#+end_src

**** magit-todos

Magit todos is interesting as it reads TODO's from the source
code comments or org buffers. It also allows you to view and sort
them which is insanely useful. It also reads the author name. It
requires either GNU grep, git grep or ripgrep which i should have
one of those anyway(also needs PCRE support). 

#+name: magit-todos
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit-todos
    :config (magit-todos-mode))
#+end_src

**** Git Timemachine

This package allows you to go back and forth between a files git
history. 

#+name: git-timemachine
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package git-timemachine
    :bind ("C-c g t" . 'git-timemachine-toggle))
#+end_src

**** Git Gutter

Shows changes, deletions or additions from master. Really useful
to see what you did and what will or wont be committed without
having to open up [[magit]].

#+name: git-gutter
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package git-gutter 
    :config (global-git-gutter-mode)) 
#+end_src
*** SOMEDAY vcmode
** Autocompletion
*** Company

Company is the newest and greatest auto completion engine for
emacs. Technically these have binds but I am not really counting
those as real keybindings because its only in effect during a
completion.

#+name: company
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package company
    :init
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)
    (setq company-require-match 'never
          company-minimum-prefix-length 2
          company-tooltip-align-annotations t
          company-idle-delay 1
          company-tooltip-limit 20
          global-company-mode t)
    :bind (:map company-active-map
                ("S-TAB" . company-select-previous)
                ("<backtab>" . company-select-previous)
                ("<return>" . nil)
                ("RET" . nil)
                ("C-SPC" . company-complete-selection)
                ("TAB" . company-complete-common-or-cycle)))
#+end_src

This is also intergrated with [[yasnippet]] for a whole bunhc of
functions.

#+name: company-mode-with-yas
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun company-mode-with-yas (backend)
    (if (and (listp backend) (member 'company-yasnippet backend))
        backend
      (append (if (consp backend) backend (list backend))
              '(:with company-yasnippet))))

  (with-eval-after-load "company"
    (with-eval-after-load "yasnippet"
      '(setq company-backends (mapcar #'company-mode-with-yas company-backends))))
#+end_src

** Projects
*** projectile

Projectile is a way to use specific commands for a specific
project. A project is any folder with a source control or a
.projectile file/folder. This is the definition of helm-projectile
however it also installs projectile. This is also intergrated into
[[helm]].

#+name: helm-projectile
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm-projectile
    :init
    (setq projectile-enable-caching t
          projectile-file-exists-local-cache-expire (* 5 60)
          projectile-file-exists-remote-cache-expire (* 10 60)
          projectile-switch-project-action 'helm-projectile-find-file
          projectile-sort-order 'recently-active)
    :config
    (projectile-mode t)
    (helm-projectile-on))
#+end_src

*** treemacs
<<treemacs-evil>><<treemacs-projectile>><<treemacs-magit>>

Treemacs is a tree layout file explorer. Its useful for projects
and has TONS of plugins to work with other plugins. It works with
[[evil]],[[projectile]], and [[magit]]. It also should have =all-the-icons= to
look pretty :p.

#+name: treemacs
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package treemacs)
  (use-package treemacs-evil
    :after '(treemacs evil))
  (use-package treemacs-projectile
    :after '(treemacs projectile))
  (use-package treemacs-magit
    :after '(treemacs magit))
  ;; Icons for treemacs
  (use-package all-the-icons)
#+end_src

** Plain Text Modes
*** Org

Org mode is the best thing since sliced bread. It allows you to do
Outlines, Planning, Capturing, Spreadsheets, Markup, Exporting,
Literite Programming and much [[https://orgmode.org/][more]].

#+name: org
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org

#+end_src
<<org-rifle>>

Org rifle is a thing that helps me search a org mode multiple org
mode buffers with [[helm]] I am mainly gonna use it to search for
locations. Note this requires [[helm]]

**** Org Exports
<<ox-pandoc>><<htmlize>><<ox-twbs>><<ox-hugo>>
There are many plugins you can install to get more exports. Here
are the 3 that I use frequently. Pandoc is nice for docx, htmlize
is for html and ox-twbs is for better html docs with
twitter-bootstrap. ox-hugo because the markdown specs are awful
and very vague so this one works on the static site generator
[[https://gohugo.io][hugo]]. See [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][here]] for doucmentation on it.

#+name: org-exports

#+end_src

**** Evil org mode

[[Org]] mode is nice but [[evil]] is also very nice. Here is the only
other one then [[magit]] that doesnt have [[evil-collection]]
keybindings.

#+name: evil-org
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package evil-org

*** LaTeX
**** TODO Auctex
- Note taken on [2019-08-18 Sun 21:52]  \\
  Add MLA style LaTeX template
<<latex>>

Auctex is supposed to be really good at showing and displaying
LaTeX. I should use latex but I normally just use org-mode.

#+name: auctex
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package tex
    :ensure auctex

*** Markdown
<<markdown>>

Markdown is dope and even though I would love to use org-mode for
everything sometimes I have to edit/view markdown.

#+name: markdown-mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package markdown-mode)
#+end_src

** Terminals
*** vterm

Very powerful terminal emulator as the project was started by
neovim to create a actual terminal emulator in neovim. This should
in theory be just as good. Unfortunately the [[https://melpa.org/][melpa]] package doesnt
install properly so you have to [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][manually]] install it. These keybinds
also don't count. [[line-numbers][Line numbers]] also dont work properly so we
disable them. Hopefully it will get [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/pull/129][fixed soon]].

#+name: vterm

#+end_src

*** eshell

Eshell is a nice interactive prompt to use with emacs. Imo this is
a really useful package as you can run shell and elisp commands
pretty easily.

#+name: eshell
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun eshell/e (file)
    (find-file file))
  (defun eshell-maybe-bol ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((p (point)))
      (eshell-bol)
      (if (= p (point))
          (beginning-of-line))))
  (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook
            '(lambda () (define-key eshell-mode-map "\C-a" 'eshell-maybe-bol)))
#+end_src

** Templates/Snippets

Yasnippets is possibly cool? It's supposed to intergrate with
[[company]] mode if I add some code which seems cool. All this does is
add the abillity to add predefined definitions in a whole bunch of
languages.

#+name: yasnippet
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package yasnippet
    :config (yas-global-mode))
#+end_src

Yasnippets requires another package for some predefined snippets so
I can actually use it without defining it myself.

#+name: yasnippet-snippets
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package yasnippet-snippets
    :config (yasnippet-snippets-initialize))
#+end_src

*** Gentoo Snippets

Gentoo comes with a skeleton for ebuilds which is nice. I would
like to include it by default.

#+name: gentoo-snippets
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'ebuild-mode-hook 'ebuild-mode-insert-skeleton)
#+end_src

** Chat programs
*** Matrix
<<matrix>>

Matrix is nice but I know nobody on it. Too bad the emacs cilient
is actually amazing...

#+name: matrix-client
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (when (not (string-equal system-type "windows-nt"))
    (use-package matrix-client
      :quelpa ((matrix-client :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/matrix-client.el"
                              :files (:defaults "logo.png" "matrix-client-standalone.el.sh")))))
#+end_src

*** Discord
**** Elcord

elcord is rich presence in discord.

#+name: elcord
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package elcord
    :config
    (setq elcord-use-major-mode-as-main-icon t)

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/Projects/Mine/rencord")
    (require 'rencord))
#+end_src

*** IRC
**** rcirc

This is the lightest irc client i think and comes
preinstalled. Also works pretty nice and barely requires a
config.

#+name: rcirc
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq rcirc-default-nick "Renzix"
        rcirc-server-alist
        '(("irc.freenode.net" :channels ("#emacs"))
          ("localhost" :channels ("#home")))
        rcirc-authinfo
        '(("irc.freenode.net" nickserv "Renzix" "Akeyla10!")
          ("localhost" bitlbee "Renzix" ("Akeyla10!"))))
  ;; Include date in time stamp.
  (setq rcirc-time-format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M ")
  ;; Keep input line at bottom.                                                                               
  (add-hook 'rcirc-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (set (make-local-variable 'scroll-conservatively)
                   8192)))
  ;; Turn on spell checking.
  (add-hook 'rcirc-mode-hook (lambda ()
                               (flyspell-mode 1)))
#+end_src

** Visual Helpers
*** beacon

Beacon just shos a light to the location where the cursor moved
to. Simple as that.

#+name: beacon
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package beacon
    :config (beacon-mode 1))
#+end_src

*** rainbow-delimiters

closing things get different highlighting so you can tell if it is
closed or not.

#+name: rainbow-delimiters
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package rainbow-delimiters
    :ghook 'prog-mode-hook)
#+end_src

*** TODO wilfred
*** which-key

which-key shows keybindings as you press them making it much
easier. Helps ALOT when learning keybinds

#+name: which-key
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package which-key
    :config (which-key-mode))
#+end_src

** Should Be in Emacs
*** expand-region

This is a single function package which expands the current region

#+name: expand-region
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package expand-region
    :config (delete-selection-mode 1))
#+end_src

** Programming
*** smartparens

smartparens allows you to edit stuff inside and move around using
parens. This is pretty useful when programming so lets load that
hook here.

#+name: smartparens
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Misc programming stuff
  (use-package smartparens
    :ghook 
    ('prog-mode-hook #'smartparens-mode)
    ('lisp-mode-hook #'smartparens-strict-mode))
#+end_src

*** LSP
<<lsp>>

lsp is basically a server that does syntax checking and stuff. The
best part about it is its editor independant so that all the
editors can improve it making it alot better.

#+name: lsp-mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package lsp-mode
    :hook
    ((scala-mode . lsp)
     (java-mode . lsp)
     (python-mode . lsp)
     (c-mode . lsp))
    :config (setq lsp-prefer-flymake nil))
#+end_src

=lsp-ui= adds a inline ui element so you can see it.

#+name: lsp-ui
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package lsp-ui
    :after lsp-mode
    :hook (lsp-mode-hook . lsp-ui-mode))
#+end_src

lsp also has [[company]] support

#+name: company-lsp
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package company-lsp
    :after '(company lsp-mode))
#+end_src

[[lsp]] also has =dap-mode= which is in [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode][alpha]] and can be used to
debug. Hopefully it gets really good eventually.

#+name: dap-mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dap-mode
    :config
    (dap-mode 1)
    (dap-ui-mode 1)
    (require 'dap-python)
    (require 'dap-java)
    (require 'dap-lldb))
#+end_src

*** JVM
**** java

All i have for java is a simple [[lsp]]. Maybe eventually I will hook
up the entire eclipse server thing too.

#+name: lsp-java
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package lsp-java)
#+end_src

**** scala

Scala lsp is part of [[lsp-mode]] so you can enable/disable it from
there. Here is just syntax highlighting for scala.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package scala-mode
    :mode "\\.s\\(cala\\|bt\\)$")
#+end_src
<<sbt>><<sbt-mode>>

this is a mode for [[scala]] package manager sbt.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package sbt-mode
    :commands sbt-start sbt-command
    :config
    ;; WORKAROUND: https://github.com/ensime/emacs-sbt-mode/issues/31
    ;; allows using SPACE when in the minibuffer
    (substitute-key-definition
     'minibuffer-complete-word
     'self-insert-command
     minibuffer-local-completion-map))
#+end_src

**** SOMEDAY kotlin
**** clojure

see [[clojure]] in the lisps section.

*** Scripting langs
**** python
<<python>>

We are using [[https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol][microsofts lsp]] because its supposed to be good. Thats
about it probably should add more. Also this is partially configured
in [[lsp-mode]]

#+name: lsp-python-ms
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package lsp-python-ms)
#+end_src

**** rakudo
<<perl6-mode>><<flycheck-perl6>>

perl6 is such a cool language but its SOO slow. Feels bad. Maybe
eventually it becomes fast and good enough to be used in
industry. Note this doesnt have that good syntax highlighting and
no lsp.

#+name: perl6
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package perl6-mode)
  (use-package flycheck-perl6
    :after flycheck)
#+end_src

**** SOMEDAY perl
**** SOMEDAY shell

*** lisps

Lisp is a really cool idea. They all have the same core idea just
change some fundemental things about it. The most used right now
are scheme, common lisp, clojure and emacs lisp. So here are the
configs for them.

**** lisp rant
Emacs lisp is probably one of the worst designed languages on
here. It has some of the complexity of common lisp and clojure
but not the simplicity of a scheme. Some differences with scheme
is that scheme has #f and #t while in emacs everything thats not
a empty list is t. No module system so everything is in a single
namespace (scheme has nonstandard ones and cl has a standard
one). Scheme also has a single namespace for variables and
functions while elisp and cl have seperate ones. In comparison to
common lisp it has WAY less standard functions which do alot
less. Also tail end recursion is actually not possible as of
right now in elisp which makes alot of things alot more
difficult. In elisp everything is also dynamic scoping meaning
that if you define a variable it is added to a global state which
is awful(you can get around this with =let=. Concurrence in elisp
is also awful. You have to use a async library which is a base
install of emacs so it becomes very hard if you use external
libraries and you have to require them inside the async function. 

**** emacs-lisp

See above for rant on elisp. This enables paredit mode for elisp
and other modes if they want it. Also does [[company]] stuff for autocompletion

**** TODO common-lisp
**** TODO clojure
**** TODO scheme
*** Microsoft/Dotnet
**** csharp
<<c#>><<omnisharp>>

csharp is still growing a emacs presence. For right now omnisharp
is what we got and its still in beta. We also have standard syntax
highlighting for it.

#+name: csharp-mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package csharp-mode)
  (use-package omnisharp
    :after 'company
    :hook (csharp-mode-hook . omnisharp-mode)
    :config
    (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-omnisharp)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.xaml\\'" . xml-mode)))
#+end_src

**** powershell

Just a major mode and simple repl for powershell. Nothing too
major.

#+name: powershell
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package powershell)
#+end_src

*** rust

Rust support is alright. Most things should work ootb with rustic
and [[lsp-mode]].

#+name: rustic
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package rustic)
#+end_src

*** c and cpp
<<c>><<cpp>>

This one uses irony server which needs to be installed. Note that
it can be installed inside emacs. Uses [[lsp]] to do stuff.

#+name: irony
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package irony
    :hook (c++-mode-hook . irony-mode)
    :hook (objc-mode-hook . irony-mode)
    :hook (c-mode-hook . irony-mode))
#+end_src

Irony also has support for [[company]].

#+name: compnay-irony
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package company-irony
    :after '(company irony))
#+end_src

This allows us to read docs while irony is working.

#+name: irony-eldoc
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package irony-eldoc
    :after '(irony))
#+end_src

*** haskell
<<lsp-haskell>><<flycheck-haskell>>

Haskell is a cool language. I should probably actually learn it one
day.

#+name: haskell-mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package haskell-mode)
  (use-package lsp-haskell
    :after lsp-mode)
  (use-package flycheck-haskell
    :after flycheck)
#+end_src

*** Google
**** dart

Dart is googles new language. I doubt im ever going to use it but
it seems cool enough to try out.

#+name: dart-mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package dart-mode)
#+end_src

**** golang

Go is fast/easy. First we can start off with the major mode.

#+name: go-mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package go-mode)
#+end_src

Then we can give it documentation popups.

#+name: go-eldoc
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package go-eldoc)
#+end_src

flymake-go is good i guess.

#+name: flymake-go
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package flymake-go)
#+end_src

and finally we can give it [[company]] completion. It should
recognize it however I havent tested it yet.

#+name: company-go
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package company-go)
#+end_src

*** Flycheck
<<flycheck-pos-tip>>

These are my flycheck settings although most packages have their
flycheck set to start in their own packages.

#+name: flycheck
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package flycheck
    :init (global-flycheck-mode))
  (use-package flycheck-pos-tip
    :after flycheck
    :config (flycheck-pos-tip-mode))
#+end_src

*** imenu

Imenu is nice to have because you can intelligently view and move
to parts of your program. This one in perticular is able to do it
anywhere and have helm support.

#+name: imenu-anywhere
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package imenu-anywhere)
#+end_src

* Keybindings

This is all of my defined keybinds. I use [[key-chord]] alot because its
a good package for [[evil]]. People rarely do things like ;; (M-x ;) and
other stuff. Btw the )) is on the end of the line because i may want
to comment out the last <<>> and that would actually comment ))
causing a syntax error.

** Rant on keybindings

There are a bunch of different ways on how to bind a key. I think
each way has its merit and should be thought of before you assign a
keybinding. states and prefixes are achived through
keymaps. Arguments are achieved through C-u or evil motions/
1-9/registers. chords are by key-chord or its in vim by
default. commands are by command mode in vim or M-x in
emacs. Modifiers are just control alt and shift etc... The big
thing that emacs has over vim is provide context to a
function. Working differently depending on where you are is
extremely powerful. Emacs also allows making new mode maps which is
the other big thing that emacs does better. Note keymaps are a
combination of states and prefixes. Vim arguments work better
however C-u is a VERY interesting idea. vim also loses to
major/minor modes as this makes plugins ALOT more modular. Allowing
multiple ways to look at a single file depending on context. I dont
absolutely hate the idea of using a mouse like in acme however I
will mention that the more you use the mouse the more likely you
will keep trying to use it. In that case you end up abandonning the
keyboard for long periods of times making it worse. Pressing escape
to do 60+ keybindings is MUCH more efficent then reaching over to
your mouse for a max of 20 keybinds which are context dependant. It
may however be easier to understand at first.

- states (insert or normal)
- prefix (emacs C-x or vim C-w)
- modes (major/minor modes or file types)
- argument (2dd or C-u)
- chords (keychord)
- commands (M-x or ex-commands)
- modifers (C-y or C-S-<backspace>)
- context (org mode C-c C-c or [[https://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/05/22/smarter-navigation-to-the-beginning-of-a-line/][this]])
- mouse (plan 9's acme?)

** Emacs State

Yes i want to be able to use emacs because i think its important to
understand different ways of doing things. Because of this I am
going to make it a 66% on startup of whether evil mode is enabled
or not. [[http://www.elmindreda.org/emacs.html][This is nice if I forget keybinds]].
