```{r, engine='bash'}
sudo apt-get install bashdb
```
* [yum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowdog_Updater,_Modified) package manager
```{r, engine='bash'}
sudo yum install bashdb
```
* installation from sources (advanced):
```{r, engine='bash'}
tar -xvf bashdb-*.tar.gz

# Overview
This is a SIMPLE bashdb debugger frontend. Useful for learning bash shell usage and writing simple scripts.

Hopefully bash will land on 3 leading platforms making this extension very useful. Useful hint: shellcheck extension does a great job with finding common script errors before debugging.

## Usage
1. Select **Debug -> Start Debugging (F5)** to start debugging (if launch.json is not available, it will be created with default configuration)
2. Select **Debug -> Add Configuration** to add custom debug configuration (drop-down, path-input, etc...)

See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging for general usage.

For Windows users:
1. Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)
2. Install bashdb through bash console: `sudo apt-get install bashdb`
3. [Optional] In launch.json, set `pathBash` to either `C:/Windows/System32/bash.exe`, or `C:/Windows/sysnative/bash.exe` in case of 32bit VSCode on 64bit OS

For macOS users: <br>
Read [here](https://github.com/rogalmic/vscode-bash-debug/wiki/macOS:-avoid-use-of--usr-local-bin-pkill) if your mac has `/usr/local/bin/pkill`.

## Dependencies
1. bashdb 4.3
2. cat, mkfifo, rm, pkill

## Limitations and known problems
* Watch variables should be specified with $ at the beginning (this expression is evaluated in bash - for example `${#PWD}` returns path length)
* The debugger supports only non-interactive scripts (no stdin)
* Currently debugger stops at first command.
* Executing `set -e` causes debugging script to exit (`bashdb` fixes this in version `4.4-0.93`). Consider using `trap 'exit $?' ERR`.
* Windows Subsystem Linux in Windows 10 (>=15014) seems to be working with some hacks (https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/2#issuecomment-209118529, https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/1489);
