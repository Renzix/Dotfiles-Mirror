#+TITLE: Goals

With doom i want to make my "Perfect" configuration. Managing emacs by myself is
actually nuts and there is no reason I cant have "Better defaults". I will keep
my own config in case doom ever dies or I ever want to switch back. Ideally
workflow wise I want to be able to use emacs and evil based keybindings. From
what I have found emacs keybindings are better if I am going to be less
formatting and coding.
