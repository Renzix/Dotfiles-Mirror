* Emacs config
My emacs config is pretty simple it consists of
- init.el
- settings.org

init.el is not meant to be used and everything is supposed to be in
settings.org

It contains alot of things including
- Evil config
- Movement Mode (evil mode i made for other stuff)
- c/cpp/rust/java/python support (might have some more)
- org mode config
- circe config (irc)
- pretty appearence
